/**
 *
 * Bob is having a array A of N elements . Bob wants to determine the beauty of the array and the
 * beauty of the array is defned as :-
 *
 * <p>Determine Bitwise OR of maximum and minimum elements of every subset of size greater than or
 * equal to 2 and add them.
 *
 * <p>As the answer can be quite large , you have to report it by taking modulo with 1000000007 .
 *
 * <p>Input
 *
 * <p>First line of the input will contain N , denoting the number of elements of the array.
 *
 * <p>Second line will contain N spaced integers denoting elements of the array .
 *
 * <p>Constraints:
 *
 * <p> 1 <= N <= 200000
 *
 * <p> 1 <= A[I] <= 1000
 *
 * <p>Output:
 *
 * <p>For each query you have to output single integer denoting beauty of the array .
 *
 * <p>Hint:
